# 👋 Hey there, I'm John.
I'm a software consultant by day, data scientist by night, and avid follower and contributor of basketball highlights and analysis by late-late-night-early-morning. 
My main education and interests include:
- Formal Learning - Econ & Business (undergrad), Data Science (Masters)
- Professional Learning - Supply Chain, Consulting, Product Management
- Personal learning - Product Design, Web Design, Basketball Analytics
- Hobbies - running, backpacking, basketball (watching), exploring (and keeping a quite detailed log & raiting system of) local restaurants/bars
For more info about me, check out [johncwhazelton.com][my site], [google.com][my LinkedIn], or [google.com][my Twitter], where I contribute suprising, exciting, and (sometimes) infuriating basketball stats and analysis.

I’m @JohnHazelton
